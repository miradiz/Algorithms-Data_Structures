    "We say that the first is a worst-case execution analysis and the latter a best-case execution analysis. When building a model for the execution time of an algorithm, we often focus on the worst case. There a few reasons for doing so:\n",

By focusing on the worst-case when building the execution time model, we can guarantee that the executions times will always behave at most as badly as the models predicts.
